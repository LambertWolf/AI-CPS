# Documentation

This folder contains the main documentation assets (plots and exported artifacts) used for reporting and the final video presentation.

## Structure

### `Ann_docu/`
Evaluation and explanation visuals for the ANN models:
- `improved_training_history.png` — training/validation loss and MAE over epochs
- `improved_scatter_plots.png` — predicted vs. actual delays (train/test)
- `model_comparison.png` — baseline vs. improved model comparison (KPIs)
- `feature_importance.png` — permutation importance (top contributing features)

### `Ols_docu/`
Evaluation visuals for the OLS baseline:
- `scatter_plots.png` — predicted vs. actual delays
- `diagnostic_plots_second.png` — regression diagnostics (e.g., residual-related plots)

### `other_docu/`
Supporting artifacts shared across models:
- `station_encoder.pkl` — fitted station encoder used for consistent stop/station encoding

## Notes
- These files are generated by the training/evaluation scripts and are referenced in the report/video.
- If you regenerate results, overwrite the corresponding files here to keep documentation in sync.
